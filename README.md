# Experiment Calculator

## About

The goal of Experiment Calculator is to provide a simple calculator to plan, analyse and diagnose simple experiments. This a python streamlit version of the [Experiment Calculator](https://github.com/sabush/ExperimentCalculator) app designed by [Stephen Bush](https://github.com/sabush).

## Usage

There are three calculators in this app.

1. A [power calculator](calculator_types/power_calculator.md) for experiment design.
    - Available for binary or normally distributed outcomes.
2. A [significance calculator](calculator_types/significance_calculator.md) for experiment result analysis.
    - Available for binary or normally distributed outcomes.
3. A [sample ratio mismatch calculator](calculator_types/srm_calculator.md) to identify statistically significant deviations from the expected sample proportions.
