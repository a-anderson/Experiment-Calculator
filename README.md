    - Available for binary or normally distributed outcomes.
2. A [significance calculator](calculator_types/significance_calculator.md) for experiment result analysis.
    - Available for binary or normally distributed outcomes.
3. A [sample ratio mismatch calculator](calculator_types/srm_calculator.md) to identify statistically significant deviations from the expected sample proportions.
